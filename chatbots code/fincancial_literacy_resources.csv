Pros and cons of dollar-cost averaging,"The document ""Dollar-Cost Averaging"" from Fidelity explains the investment strategy of dollar-cost averaging (DCA), which involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of market fluctuations. This method aims to manage risk by potentially lowering the average purchase price of investments over time. An example illustrates how investing $1,000 monthly over five months can result in a lower average stock price compared to a lump sum investment. While DCA can mitigate risks associated with market volatility and reduce the impact of emotional decision-making, it may also limit potential returns if prices rise consistently. The strategy is particularly useful for investors who want to avoid market timing and prefer a disciplined investment approach. However, investors should be aware of potential trading fees and the lower returns from funds held in cash while waiting to be invested. DCA aligns with long-term investment goals and helps manage risk but should be evaluated based on individual financial objectives.",https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/dollar-cost-averaging
Traditional or Roth account? 2 tips to help you choose,"The document ""Roth IRA or Traditional IRA or 401(k)"" from Fidelity discusses how to choose between traditional and Roth retirement accounts. The key difference lies in taxation: traditional accounts offer pre-tax contributions with tax-deferred growth and taxes on withdrawals, while Roth accounts use post-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals.

Roth accounts provide more flexibility with penalty-free access to contributions and no required minimum distributions (RMDs), unlike traditional accounts. The document also considers individual saving habits, suggesting that Roth accounts might benefit those who tend to spend their tax savings, as taxes are already paid upfront.
